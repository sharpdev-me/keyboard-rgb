# Custom RGB Software for HyperX Alloy Origins Core

This was just a hobby project (I hate the HyperX software), this will almost definitely not work on your keyboard.

The most important file here is `connections/keyboard.ts`, it actually send messages to the device. If you want to get it to work, that's the best place to start.

Yes, my code is messy. No, I don't care.
